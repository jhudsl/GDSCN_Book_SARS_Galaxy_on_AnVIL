## Notes for Instructors {-}

Depending on your needs, you might decide to run this Galaxy activity on a different cloud provider, such as the original [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/). More information about Galaxy is available at [training.galaxyproject.org](https://training.galaxyproject.org).

We estimate a cost of roughly $2.00 per student to run this activity on AnVIL.
